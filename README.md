# Hidden India: Sensor-Based Danger Detection Platform

Developed during a hackathon, Hidden India is a smart monitoring solution designed to improve safety in challenging environments. The system utilizes three key sensors—sound, vibration, and humidity—to detect potential risks and send timely alerts.

## Key Features
- **Sound Sensor:** Monitors for abnormal noise levels that may indicate dangerous activity.
- **Vibration Sensor:** Detects unusual ground tremors or mechanical shocks for early warning.
- **Humidity Sensor:** Tracks moisture changes that could signal unsafe conditions (e.g., risk of landslides, flooding, or electrical hazards).

## How It Works
- All sensor data is captured and processed in real time.
- The platform analyzes these inputs to determine if a potential danger is present.
- When a threat is detected, users receive instant notifications, helping them avoid harm.

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** Sound, vibration, and humidity sensors (Arduino/Raspberry Pi platform recommended)
- **Software:** Real-time data ingestion and analysis (code details here)
- **Alerts:** Custom logic for recognizing dangerous thresholds and sending notifications

## Use Cases
- Monitoring remote or hazardous locations (construction sites, mines, flood zones)
- Safety systems for rural or underdeveloped areas
- Quick deployment for disaster prevention during events or emergencies
